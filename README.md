Description:
In this project, I created a clone of the Amazon website's user interface using HTML and CSS. This project was undertaken to enhance my skills in front-end web development, focusing on replicating a complex and widely recognized e-commerce platform.

Key Features:
Detailed Layout: Recreated the Amazon homepage, including the header, navigation menu, product listings, and footer, paying close attention to detail.
Styling: Utilized CSS to match Amazon's styling, including fonts, colors, and spacing, to create an authentic look and feel.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the content and layout of the pages.
CSS3: For styling the UI components, including Flexbox and Grid for layout management.
